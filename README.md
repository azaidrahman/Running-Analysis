## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze my personal running data from Strava to gain insights into my performance and improvement over time. The analysis includes data cleaning, determining improvement metrics, analyzing overall improvement, and calculating the rate of improvement.

## Data Cleaning

The first step in this project was to clean the Strava data to make it suitable for analysis. This involved:

- Removing irrelevant columns
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types
- Creating derived features

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work

- Discover how much affect time has to running
- Incorporate weather data to analyze its impact on performance
- Analyze the effect of different types of workouts on overall improvement
- Develop a machine learning model to predict future performance
